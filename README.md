# MASKiT
MASKiT App is an image editor app developed by Ori Frenkel and Shai Gindin. The app has been designed to promote privacy among users by enabling them to cover unwanted faces in the images. The app helps users to avoid sharing unnecessary personal data and guarantee maximum security.

The app main advantages are:
 1.	Itâ€™s fast,  since processing happens on the device, there is no network latency.
 2.	Works offline - you can rely on our app even when the network is spotty or you are in  area without connectivity.
 3. Privacy is retained: since all processing is performed locally, there is no need to send sensitive user data over the network to a server.

Note: this app is a project made as a part of Android course at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem
